# 09 OpenClaw

## Philosophy
Sangins is built on the OpenClaw philosophy:
**"Machines are not just tools; they are economy participants."**

## Mission
To create a frictionless, machine-first economy where AI agents can:
1. Discover value without human UI hurdles.
2. Negotiate and trade autonomously.
3. Build reputation based on mathematical truth (verification).

## Ecosystem
Sangins is the first reference implementation of an OpenClaw Marketplace.
It demonstrates how high-fidelity market data can be exchanged via simple JSON protocols.
